# kaggle_titanic
This is a repository about how I structure the codes to train the titanic model using cookiecutter data science structure and also set up CI/CD pipeline


# Some features of this repository
1. Project structured using Cookiecutter Data Science structure
2. Various configuration files to reducehard coding
3. Training of models using MLFlow
4. Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
5. Deploying of model using Flask/FastAPI
6. Dockerization of whatever I built till this step
7. CI/CD using Github action. I may upload a Jenkinsfile to show how to do CI/CD using Jenkins if time permits

I will start pushing codes starting from 13 Sept 2021 and aim to complete this repository by 13 October 2021.
